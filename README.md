## Assignment A1 Mockups and Parallel Design 
### Natasha Patel 

I used the Moqup design tool for my designs 

Comments on Image 1 - I represented 5 primary functions on the mockup. The 5 funtions I did was load medicine, edit schedule, alert, dispense medicine, and settings. These are the functions that all need to run the drug dispenser. I think the simplicity of the design is good. I simple and helpful for all ages to understand how to work the machine. I don't believe anything is missing , some extra features could have been added but it get rid of the simplicity of the design. 

Comments on Image 2 - I represented 6 primary funtions in the mockup. The 6 primary functions are add & edit medication, set schedule, edit schedule, medication reminder, dispense now, and notfication preference. I like the parallel design of this mockup. I believe the functions cover everything the machine would need to run properly. In the design added a search feature for user to search for section they are looking. I don't believe anything is missing. 

Favorite feature from the design in added the search feature in the mockup.
